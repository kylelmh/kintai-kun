Kintai-kun is a lightweight digital timecard web app written in Django.
The production uses an nginx reverse proxy for processing static files.

It is currently in beta.

Please compile SASS files locally.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

To deploy the server,

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-deploy.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-deploy.yml up -d
```
